        <h1>History Of The Artists Life</h1>
        
        
        <h2>Early Life</h2>
          <p><sub>
          
            On March 30, 1853, Vincent Willem van Gogh was born in the Netherlands. He was the child of Theodorus van Gogh and Anna Cornelia Carbentus. His parents named him after his brother and grandfather, who were both stillborn a year before his birth. His grandfather was Vincent, an art dealer who studied theology at the University of Leiden. His mother came from a rich family in The Hague. His father was Theodorus' brother, and his mother married Cornelia, who was his sister. His brother was born on May 1, 1857.
              <br> <br>
            His mother was a strict and religious woman, who would often stress the importance of family. Van Gogh stayed in touch with his siblings, Theo and Willemina. The Church provided the family with a house, a maid, a horse, and a carriage. Anna also taught the children a duty to maintain their high social status.
              <br><br>
            Van Gogh was a serious and intelligent child, and he was taught by his mother and a governess. In 1864, he was sent to a boarding school at Zevenbergen, and in 1866, he was sent to a middle school in Tilburg. At an early age, he was encouraged to draw, though his early drawings were not as intense as his later work. His philosophy was that art should not be about technique but about capturing the impressions of common objects. Van Gogh's unhappiness overshadowed the lessons, and he left home in March 1868. He later wrote that his youth was cold and sterile.

        <h2>As An Emerging Artist</h2>
            <p><sub>
          
            In Nuenen, Van Gogh worked on drawing and painting. He also completed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Parsonage_Garden_at_Nuenen">The Passonage Garden</a>, which was stolen in 2020. In 1884, he met a young woman named Margot Begemann, who he fell in love with.
            They wanted to get married, but their families did not approve. Margot tried to kill herself by overdosing on strychnine, but she survived after Van Gogh attended to her. <br><br>
            During his stay in Nuenen in 1885, Van Gogh painted several still lifes. He also completed over 200 oil paintings. During his stay, he mainly used sombre tones and dark brown. <br><br>
            In 1885, a dealer in Paris asked Vincent if he had any paintings that were ready to exhibit. He responded by creating <a href="https://www.vangoghmuseum.nl/en/collection/s0005v1962">The Potato Eaters</a> and a series of character studies.
            In August, his work was displayed in the shop windows of Leurs, a dealer in The Hague. In September 1885, one of his peasant sitters got pregnant, and the village priest told the congregation not to model for him.

        <h2> Why Did Van Gogh Shoot Himself?</h2>
         <p><sub>
          
            In the book, Naifeh and Smith argue that it was unlikely for van Gogh to have killed himself, noting the upbeat disposition of the paintings he created immediately preceding his death; furthermore, in private correspondence, van Gogh described suicide as sinful and immoral. On July 27, 1890, Van Gogh shot himself in the chest using a Lefaucheux pinfire revolver. He died a few hours later, and the incident was not witnessed by anyone. The bullet was deflected by a rib, and it passed through his chest without apparent damage. <br><br>
            He was taken to the Auberge Ravoux. There, he was treated by two doctors, but he could not have his bullet removed due to the lack of a surgeon. The following day, Theo went to his brother's side and found him in good spirits. <br><br>
            On July 29, Vincent's health began to fail, and he died in the early hours of the following day. According to Theo, his last words were "the sadness will last forever". Click here to <a id="tribute"
